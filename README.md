# Retail Sales Performance Analysis
(Global Superstore Project)

## Problem Statement
Retail sales data from the Global Superstore is multi-dimensional and can be hard to analyze due to varied regions, states/cities, product categories, discounts, and order metrics.  
Manual analysis for identifying trends, growth drivers, and risks is challenging, especially as the data volume grows large.

## Objective
- Analyze the “Global Superstore” dataset to uncover trends, opportunities, and risks in sales, profit, and order metrics across regions, states/cities, product categories, and more.
- Provide actionable insights on:
  - Sales growth and profitability over time
  - Product and category performance
  - Geographic profit and margin trends
  - Impact of discount, shipping, and delivery
  - Customer segmentation and repeat purchases

## Analysis Scope
- Yearly and monthly sales, profit, and quantity trends
- Top-performing products and categories (by sales and profit)
- Profit margin analysis by region/state/city
- Effect of discounts on profit margins and quantity sold
- Identifying break-even discount points
- Year-over-Year growth in sales/profit
- Shipping and delivery lead time performance
- Products/categories with negative profit

## Key Insights
- *Total Sales, Profit, Quantity Over Time*  
  Some regions consistently grow sales/profit, but high sales do not always mean high profit. Profit margin must be tracked alongside sales.

- *Top-Performing Products & Categories*  
  Top-selling items by revenue often have lower margins. Some categories/sub-categories dominate both sales and profit.

- *Geographic Profitability*  
  Not all high-sales regions are high-profit (e.g., South sales strong, profit margins lower than West). Local strategies matter.

- *Discount & Margin Analysis*  
  Higher discounts (0–10%, 10–20%, >20%) increase sales but reduce margins past a threshold. More sales does not always mean higher profit.

- *Discount vs. Quantity Sold*  
  Discounts boost sales quantity up to a point, but excess discounting starts to lower overall profit.

- *Year-over-Year Growth*  
  YoY metrics highlight expanding and stagnating regions/categories (e.g., South region returned to positive growth post-2015).

- *Shipping/Delivery Performance*  
  Regions and ship modes with slower delivery times must be targeted for operational improvements.

- *Products with Negative Profit*  
  Negative-profit products/categories require review, cost control, or discontinuation.

## Recommendations
- Focus inventory and promotions on high-margin products/categories.
- Optimize regional strategies to boost profits in low-margin areas.
- Fine-tune discount policies to avoid crossing profit break-even points.
- Improve supply chain for slow-delivering regions/or ship modes.
- Segment customers and use YoY growth stats to target rising segments and loyal buyers.

## Conclusion
Global Superstore analysis uncovers opportunities, pain points, and profit levers. Leveraging these will help optimize business strategies, maximize profit, target marketing, and foster sustainable retail growth.
